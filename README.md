## Problem Statement

Academic institutions often struggle with a disjointed and manual paper management process. Papers are scattered across physical storage and various digital formats, leading to significant challenges in version tracking, collaboration, and discovery. This time-consuming, error-prone workflow creates confusion and delays for researchers, reviewers, and administrators alike.

Our **AI-Powered Academic Paper Management System** directly tackles these issues by providing a centralized, intelligent platform that organizes papers, automates tedious tasks, and streamlines the entire academic workflow.

## Key Features

The system offers distinct features tailored to each user role:

| Feature | For Researchers | For Admins/Editors | For Students/Readers |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Paper & Version Management** | ✅ |  overseen | ✅ (read-only) |
| **AI Metadata Extraction** | ✅ | ✅ |  N/A |
| **AI Paper Summarization** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **AI Contextual Search** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **AI Paper Recommendations** | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| **AI-Highlighted Version Changes** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Automated Citation Generation** | ✅ | N/A | ✅ |
| **Analytics & Monitoring Dashboard** | N/A | ✅ | N/A |
| **User & Role Management** | N/A | ✅ | N/A |
| **Security & Anomaly Detection**| N/A | ✅ | N/A |
| **Personal Collections & Bookmarks**| N/A | N/A | ✅ |

## System Architecture & Tech Stack

APMS is built as a modern web application, containerized for easy deployment and scalability.

-   **Backend:** **Python** with **Flask** for creating the REST API.
-   **Frontend:** **JavaScript** with **React.js** for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
-   **AI & Machine Learning:** **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** for NLP tasks (summarization, search, recommendations). **Pandas** for data manipulation.
-   **Database:** **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** for robust data storage.
-   **Web Server:** **Nginx** or **Apache** as a reverse proxy and for serving static files.
-   **Containerization:** **Docker** and **Docker Compose** to ensure a consistent development and deployment environment.
-   **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):** **SQLAlchemy** to interact with the database.

## System Design

### Use Case Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the primary interactions between users (actors) and the system's core functionalities.

![Use Case Diagram](./docs/use-case-diagram.png)
*(**Note**: Make sure to place your `use-case-diagram.png` inside a `docs` folder in your repository for this link to work.)*

For detailed descriptions of each use case, please see the [Use Case Specification Document](./docs/USE_CASES.md).

### User Roles

The system is designed for three primary user profiles:

1.  **Researchers**: The content creators. They can upload papers, manage versions, and track the status of their work. They benefit from AI tools that automate metadata and citation generation.
2.  **Admins/Editors**: The system managers. They oversee submissions, manage user roles, and monitor system health and security through an analytics dashboard.
3.  **Students/Readers**: The content consumers. They can search for papers using an intelligent engine, read AI-generated summaries, organize papers into collections, and receive personalized recommendations.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed on your machine:
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/academic-paper-management-system.git
    cd academic-paper-management-system
    ```

2.  **Build and run the containers:**
    This single command will build the images for the frontend, backend, and database services and start them.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3.  **Access the application:**
    Once the containers are running, you can access the web application in your browser at:
    [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Default login credentials will be provided for initial testing.

## Project Methodology

This project is developed using the **Incremental Software Development Model**. This approach was chosen for several key reasons:
-   **Early Value Delivery**: Core functionalities like paper submission and search can be delivered first, providing immediate value to users.
-   **Flexibility & Feedback**: Each increment allows for stakeholder feedback, ensuring the final product aligns with user needs. AI features can be refined and added progressively.
-   **Risk Reduction**: Developing in smaller chunks minimizes the risk of large-scale failures and allows for easier testing and integration of complex modules like the AI engine.

## Roadmap

The following features are planned for future increments:

-   [ ] **Advanced Plagiarism Detection**: Integrate with third-party APIs to check for originality.
-   [ ] **Collaborative Editing**: Allow multiple researchers to co-author and comment on papers in real-time.
-   [ ] **Expanded Notification System**: Add email and in-app alerts for status changes and updates.
-   [ ] **Enhanced Analytics**: Provide more granular, visual data on research trends and author productivity.
-   [ ] **Public API**: Offer an API for other institutional tools to interact with the system.
